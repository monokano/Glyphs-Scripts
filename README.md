# Scripts for Glyphs
The script with JP in the name is for those who make Japanese fonts. Comments and alerts are written in Japanese.


## Description

### Switch Direction JP
  * Toggles the direction of edit view (Horizontal/Vertical).
  * Updates the information display to match the glyph display when switching.
#### How to use
This script displays its own panel window. Use the buttons on the window to switch. Requires Python module.

### Make vrt2 Glyph JP
  * Creates a new vrt2 (.rotat) glyph based on the selected glyphs.
  * A .rotat glyph has its base glyph as a component.
      * If a .rotat already exists, a base glyph is placed as a component.
  * If a selected glyph is a .rotat, the .rotat base glyph is placed as a component.
#### How to use
Select the glyph in the list view before running the script. Be sure to update the feature after that. No Python module required.
